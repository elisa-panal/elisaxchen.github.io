H﻿ello! I'm a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. Currently, I work with [Anjali Adukia](https://voices.uchicago.edu/anjali/) and the wonderful team at the [MiiE lab](https://www.miielab.com/) to examine inequality in representation in children’s books using computational methods. I also work on development projects that explore the relationship between education, marriage, health, migration, and individuals’ fixed physical characteristics such as skin color in Bangladesh. 

I’m interested in development economics, with a focus on gender and political economy. My long-term goal is to use a combination of methods such as field experiments and computational tools to conduct research that benefits people living on the periphery in developing countries, and the US. 

In another life, I’ve spent the last few years building the National Voting Rights Data Analytics team at [Asian Law Caucus](https://www.advancingjustice-alc.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyt-ZBhCNARIsAKH1177GrCL7wq4f3pwjc6GI2mNCfN6e5UJg0sP6KAmMZfXDvnwzCYSslG4aAg0wEALw_wcB), a non-profit legal-aid organization based in Oakland / San Francisco. We provide data analysis to support voting rights litigation and conduct empirical research with the goal of increasing minority turnout, civic participation, and representation. 

My research career began at UW-Madison, where I majored in History, Mathematics, and Economics. I spent two years digging into archives and writing my senior thesis in history on US foreign relations with El Salvador, refugee settlements, and migrant labor advocacy in Los Angeles.
